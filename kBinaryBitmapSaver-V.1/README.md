# Unity3D Editor package - kBinaryBitmapSaver

**kBinaryBitmapSaver** is a tool for creating byte array files from bitmaps. 
The tool copies a selected bitmap file, from the user environment, into a 
folder in your unity project. It will be converted into a byte array and 
will be stored with a selectable extension, in a data file.

The process of the texture import can adjusted in the Texture Importer window.
The extension of the export data array file can be customized within the Export
Extension window.
